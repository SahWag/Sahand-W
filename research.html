I am interested in all aspects of intelligent robotics, with a passion that lies at the intersection of nonlinear control, machine learning and its interaction with embodied intelligence. 
I enjoy learning about the mathematical fundamentals that underly these concepts, and how to apply them in intelligent control. 
I believe that by offloading more control from software and embedded to the mechanics and body, we will be able to design robots that are both easier to control and more robust in unstructured environments.

I will use this page later to add both my own research and papers I've been reading that I find highly interesting.
