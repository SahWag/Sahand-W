      At the age of eleven, I randomly took a course in game programming for kids through my elementary school. 
      What initially started as a one-off course, ended up being one of my most significant hobbies all the way from high school up until now.
      This hobby has not only provided me with a lot of programming and system design experience, it has also allowed me to collaborate and communicate with many talented individuals from all around the world,
      which has been immensely enjoyable and educational :)
      <br/>
      As my interests have shifted more towards robotics and I started learning more about this topic, I've slowly started thinking game development and robotics share a lot of common challenges, 
      especially when it comes to the design of non-playable characters: Just as modern robotics are concerned with developing both the reasoning and interaction capabilities of autonomous embodied agents, 
      game development does the same with these characters. However, unlike robotics, where we are limited by the physical world and can only slightly control the environment, 
      in videogames we are able to have near-complete control of the environment and physics as well. Nonetheless, I still believe the thinking and design process in game development can be highly beneficial to
      robotic design and modelling as well.
      <br/>
      While I make videogames as a hobby and thus do not concern myself much completing the finished product, the rest of this page contains some projects I thought to be interesting to showcase :)
      <br/>
      For all games below, My main responsibilities were programming and game design unless specified otherwise.

      <small><i>Made using: C++ & SFML-2 &emsp; Responsible for: Game design, programming & art</i></small>
      <br/>
        <br/>
      An ongoing project where I aim to develop mostly anything from scratch, using C++ and only the SFML-2 framework for rendering and keyboard input capabilities.
      My goal with this project is to develop a videogame while applying common methods from robotics (e.g. state-space physics, AI) to see whether this aids or hampers development.
      <br/>
        Infinitower is a Platformer Action Roguelike with survival and exploration elements in a minimalistic pixel art style. 
        Escape the grasp of time and ascend a seemingly never-ending tower to discover what’s above the clouds! 
        Explore the surrounding floating islands, set up camps to spend the night and improve your gear until you’re ready to tackle the next floor!

      <small><i>Made using: GMS2 &emsp; Responsible for: Game design & programming</i></small>
        <br/>
        A game made in 72 hours where you endlessly go through a procedurally generated world, taking over enemies before your time runs out. Here, we worked with a team of 5.

      <small><i>Made using: GMS2 &emsp; Responsible for: Game design & programming</i></small>
        <br/>
      A series of prototypes developed with artist and game designer <a href="https://x.com/chariospirale">Chariospirale</a>. Here, my focus was to employ
        vector-based collision rather than a finite-grid to achieve a more seamless and natural-looking world. 
        The goal is to explore a mysterious world as a dog warrior to find your missing bone.

        <br/>
      A game made in 72 hours where you explore procedurally generated planets to collect fuel and find your way home before the monsters get you.
        Here, I worked together with artist and game designer <a href="https://x.com/chariospirale">Chariospirale</a>, and we focused on designing a unique game-loop
        which consists of resource gathering and low-input real-time strategy through group building.

      <small><i>Made using: GMS2 &emsp; Responsible for: Game design, programming & art</i></small>
      <br/>
      A game made in 72 hours where you explore a world as a group of followers carrying around a mysterious casket. My goal here was to play around with the idea of the playable character, 
        controlling a small swarm rather than an individual actor.

      <small><i>Made using: GMS2 &emsp; Responsible for: Game design & programming</i></small>
        <br/>
      A game made in 72 hours where you survive your way through a hostile world and assimilate body parts to grow stronger.
        My goal was to expriment with how movement and character design/progression could be modularized.
      Here, we worked with a team of 5, collaboratively developing and designing the game from scratch.
