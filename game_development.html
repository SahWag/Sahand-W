      At the age of eleven, I randomly took a course in game programming for kids through my elementary school. 
      What initially started as a one-off course, ended up being one of my most significant hobbies all the way from high school up until now.
      This hobby has not only provided me with a lot of programming and system design experience, it has also allowed me to collaborate and communicate with many talented individuals from all around the world,
      which has been immensely enjoyable and educational :)
      <br/>
      As my interests have shifted more towards robotics and I started learning more about this topic, I've slowly started thinking game development and robotics share a lot of common challenges, 
      especially when it comes to the design of non-playable characters: Just as modern robotics are concerned with developing both the reasoning and interaction capabilities of autonomous embodied agents, 
      game development does the same with these characters. However, unlike robotics, where we are limited by the physical world and can only slightly control the environment, 
      in videogames we are able to have near-complete control of the environment and physics as well. Nonetheless, I still believe the thinking and design process in game development can be highly beneficial to
      robotic design and modelling as well.
      <br/>
      While I make videogames as a hobby and thus do not concern myself much completing the finished product, the rest of this page contains some projects I thought to be interesting to showcase :)

      For all games below, My main responsibilities were programming and game design unless specified otherwise.
