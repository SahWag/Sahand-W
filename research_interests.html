      Here, I intend to go a bit deeper into describing my interests related to robotic research.
      As I have a background in mechanical engineering, control and intelligent systems, my main passion is the intersection of these fields, which happen to align perfectly with robotics!
      <br/>
      In recent times, we have seen a huge leap in the many related subfields when it comes to autonomous robots meant for traversing human-centric environments rather than controlled factory/lab settings.
      Consider in this the advancements in self-driving cars and their sensing capabilities, the use of large-language models for human-robot interaction and text-to-action research, and furthermore the
      advancements in legged locomotion: Quadrupedal robots are starting to be deployed for inspection tasks at oil platforms and factories. 
      As for bipedal robots, many copmanies pushing forward to bring the first viable humanoid robots on the market. 
      <br/>
      Besides this, soft robotic systems are advancing at a steady pace and torque control has become a nearly industry standard for modern robotic arms and manipulators, 
      allowing for safer interactions between robots and their environment.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To me, the most interesting aspect of robotics is related to this enabling of interactions between the robot and the environment. 
      I believe that for robots to become truly useful in uncontrolled and chaotic spaces, these interactions are vital. 
      However, besides making advancements in higher bandwidth sensing/actuation; larger and more advanced machin learning models for improved reasoning and model capture; and higher fidelity perception;
      I believe smart design for embodied intelligence can play a huge role in making robots more fluid, capable and most of all explainable. I am inspired by the field of soft robotics in this aspect: By
      employing the morphology of the robot and its physical properties, abilities such as safe environment interaction or variable shape grasping can be greatly simplified and even improved compared to classic control.
      <br/>
      My research goals is to obtain more insight into the effects of robot morphologies and designs and to combine this with state-of-the-art dynamic control, perception and machine learning to enable us to create 
      smarter, more capable and explainable robotic systems that can truly benefit people directly.
