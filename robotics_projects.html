      For now, I've left out most of my projects related to coursework and machine learning, but I might add them to the page later.

      <strong>Thesis: Exciting Eigenmanifolds of mechanical underactuated nonlinear systems</strong>

      The study of nonlinear normal modes deals with the
  identification and discovery of stable periodic evolutions
  of nonlinear systems in the absence of actuation. This is
  especially interesting for robotic manipulators, as they are
  often tasked with performing single trajectories many times.
  Exploiting these nonlinear normal modes can substantially
  reduce the energy expenditure of controllers compared to more
  traditional control methods. In tasks like locomotion, modal excitation can assist in both leg design and trajectory generation.<br/>
  During my literature research, I was looking into the possibility of using nonlinear normal modes for continuum soft manipulators.
  However, in my search I found that, while quite some work is available on the excitation of nonlinear modes for robotic applications, specifically through
        Eigenmanifold theory (Add a reference here), every work assumes full actuation of the system. Since continuum manipulators are infinitely underactuated,
        this is a significant research gap to fill. As such, the focus of my thesis shifted towards the question how we can excite modes of underacuated systems
        with lower degrees of actuation first.
  <br/>
        To make this work, I am employing state-feedback linearization methods to prove we can excite the modes of nonlinear underactuated mechanical systems given
        specific restraints on the system we consider. So far, this project has taught me a lot related to soft robotic modelling and control, nonlinear control (and proving stability for nonlinear control)
        and differential geometry. While my thesis is not yet finished, I hope to be able to share more information soon!

        Project MARCH is a student-led research project where a multidisciplinary group of students spends a full-time (usually more than full-time) year designing,
        programming and building a fully motorized exoskeleton for paraplegic patients. Every year, a new team starts and creates a new and improved design, and every
        four years we participate in the CYBATHLON in Zürich.<br/>
        I was personally part of the software & control department of the 8th year of project MARCH. In this year, our goal was to design an exoskeleton that enabled
        the pilot to walk without crutches. In this team, I was responsible for designing and programming the motion planning algorithms, along with the state estimation of the robot.
        Furthermore, I had the honour of presenting our software and motion planning design in front of a crowd of 500 people, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
        <br/>
        For the motion planning, we researched various state-of-the-art locomotion techniques for bipedal locomotion. Here, I implemented a footstep-planner based MPC algorithm
        using ACADOS, along with an inverse kinematics solver using Pinocchio. I also designed and implemented the state estimation stack, which employed our encoders, torque sensors and IMUs to
        calculate the center of mass and zero moment point. Besides this, I implemented a bridge between the MuJoCo simulator and ROS 2 for plug-and-play simulations.
        <br/>
        Being part of this team not only taught me a lot of skils related to research, programming, motion planning and locomotion, but also gave me a lot of hands-on experience
        related to working with physical robots and making sure the simulation results transfer well to real-life. 
        I also got to experience what it's like working with both a very large, multidisciplinary team, and working and planning with a smaller, 
        more dedicated team (the software and control team). Overall, this experience has been priceless to me :)

      <strong>Stogl robotics - Task-agnostic, machine tending</strong>

        For my internship, my aim was to design a ROS 2 software architecture for general machine tending tasks of manipulators.
        I started the project with to goals in mind: to be robot-agnostic, and task-agnostic. We believed this would be highly beneficial for
        the (partial) automatisation of a variety of general manipulator tasks with a high repeatability. By designing the architecture in such a way
        that it is very easy to both make use of another robot and to define the task differently without making many code changes, the setup becomes
        highly reusable for many companies, and does not require a high expertise in robotics-specific skills like ROS 2 or motion planning.
        As such, user-explainability and the ease at which tasks can be modified are a big priority in the project.<br/>
        For this project, I modified the existing digital twin setup provided by the company and wrote my own high-level planning stack. This planning system
        is based on PDDL and is made modular in such a way that it becomes easy to define new tasks through only modifying the knowledge base rather than any
        deployed code, improving accessibility. For the motion planner, I employed moveit2.

        As this project just started, I can unfortunately not share much of the results or progress. What I can share is that I've joined this small-scale 
        student research project where we aim to design and create a tailed bipedal robot. Once I can share more, I will! :)
