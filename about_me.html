 &#9635 I was born in the Netherlands on the 8th of December, 2000. In 2021, I completed my 
      <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/wb/bsc-werktuigbouwkunde">
        Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at TU Delft</a>. 
      Afterwards, I started the Master's programme <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/robotics/msc-robotics">Robotics at TU Delft</a>
      <br/>
 &#9635 After completing my coursework, I took a year off to dedicate all my time to being a software and robotics engineer for <a href="https://www.projectmarch.nl/">Project MARCH</a>,
      a student-led research project where we designed, built and programmed an fully motorized lower-body exoskeleton for a paraplegic pilot. <br/>
 &#9635 Now, I'm finishing up my degree programme, I'm currently writing my thesis on Eigenmanifold control for underactuated robotic systems.
