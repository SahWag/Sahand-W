The study of nonlinear normal modes deals with the identification and discovery of stable periodic evolutions of nonlinear systems in the absence of actuation. This is especially interesting for robotic manipulators, as they are often tasked with performing single trajectories many times. Exploiting these nonlinear normal modes can substantially reduce the energy expenditure of controllers compared to more traditional control methods. In tasks like locomotion, modal excitation can assist in both leg design and trajectory generation.
During my literature research, I was looking into the possibility of using nonlinear normal modes for continuum soft manipulators. However, in my search I found that, while quite some work is available on the excitation of nonlinear modes for robotic applications, specifically through Eigenmanifold theory (Add a reference here), every work assumes full actuation of the system. Since continuum manipulators are infinitely underactuated, this is a significant research gap to fill. As such, the focus of my thesis shifted towards the question how we can excite modes of underacuated systems with lower degrees of actuation first.
To make this work, I am employing state-feedback linearization methods to prove we can excite the modes of nonlinear underactuated mechanical systems given specific restraints on the system we consider. So far, this project has taught me a lot related to soft robotic modelling and control, nonlinear control (and proving stability for nonlinear control) and differential geometry. While my thesis is not yet finished, I hope to be able to share more information soon!
