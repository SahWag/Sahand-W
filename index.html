      Hello! I am Sahánd, currently (2024) a graduate student at the 
      <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/robotics/msc-robotics">COR department of Delft University of Technology</a>.
      With this website I aim to share a bit about myself, my research passions and my past and current projects.<br/>
      I am generally interested in most aspects of intelligent robotic systems, but my passion lies at the intersection of nonlinear control, machine learning
      and how bio-inspired design shapes embodied intelligence. I am strongly passionate about enabling robots to have smooth, intelligent and explainable
      interactions (specifically, locomotion) with their environment through harmonious design of their mechanics and control.<br/> 
      If anything here interests you or you want to get in touch, please send me a message on Linkedin! :)
