      Hello! I am Sahánd, currently (2024) a graduate student at the 
      <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/robotics/msc-robotics">COR department of Delft University of Technology</a>.
      With this website I aim to share a bit about myself, my research passions and my past and current projects.<br/>
      I am generally interested in most aspects of intelligent robotic systems( machine learning, computer vision, motion planning),
      but my passion lies at the intersection of nonlinear control, motion planning, machine learning
      and how bio-inspired design shapes embodied intelligence. I am strongly passionate about enabling robots to have smooth, intelligent and explainable
      interactions (specifically, locomotion) with their environment through harmonious design of their mechanics and control.<br/> 
      If anything here interests you or you want to get in touch, please send me a message on Linkedin! :)
      <br/><br/>
      Please note that the website is in very early stages of development, but I am aiming to keep the content related to my research and projects up to date!
