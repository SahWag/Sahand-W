<div class="project" id='infinitower'>
<div class="section-column-large" style="text-align:justify;">
An ongoing project where I aim to develop mostly anything from scratch, using C++ and only the SFML-2 framework for rendering and keyboard input capabilities.
My goal with this project is to develop a videogame while applying common methods from robotics (e.g. state-space physics, AI) to see whether this aids or hampers development.

<div class="section-column-large" style="text-align:justify;">
A game made in 72 hours where you endlessly go through a procedurally generated world, taking over enemies before your time runs out. 
<br>
Here, we worked with a team of 5.

<div class="project-hidden" id='bushidog'>
<div class="section-column-large" style="text-align:justify;">
A series of prototypes developed with artist and game designer <a href="https://x.com/chariospirale">Chariospirale</a>. Here, my focus was to employ
vector-based collision rather than a finite-grid to achieve a more seamless and natural-looking world. 
The goal is to explore a mysterious world as a dog warrior to find your missing bone.

<div class="project-hidden" id='findhome'>
<div class="section-column-large" style="text-align:justify;">
A game made in 72 hours where you explore procedurally generated planets to collect fuel and find your way home before the monsters get you.
        Here, I worked together with artist and game designer <a href="https://x.com/chariospirale">Chariospirale</a>, and we focused on designing a unique game-loop
        which consists of resource gathering and low-input real-time strategy through group building.

<div class="project-hidden" id='pilgrimage'>
<div class="section-column-large" style="text-align:justify;">
A game made in 72 hours where you explore a world as a group of followers carrying around a mysterious casket. My goal here was to play around with the idea of the playable character, 
        controlling a small swarm rather than an individual actor.

<div class="project-hidden" id='beanguys'>
<div class="section-column-large" style="text-align:justify;">
A game made in 72 hours where you survive your way through a hostile world and assimilate body parts to grow stronger.
	My goal was to expriment with how movement and character design/progression could be modularized. 
	Given more time, I would have loved to implement some sort of modular IK solver system.
  Here, we worked with a team of 5, collaboratively developing and designing the game from scratch.
