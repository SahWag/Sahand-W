	 <li>Hello! I am Sah√°nd, currently (2025) a graduate student at the 
		  <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/robotics/msc-robotics">COR department of Delft University of Technology</a>.
		  With this website I aim to share a bit about myself, my research passions and my past and current projects.</li>
	 <li>I am generally interested in most aspects of intelligent robotic systems( machine learning, computer vision, motion planning),
		  but my passion lies at the intersection of nonlinear control, machine learning
		  and how bio-inspired design shapes embodied intelligence.</li>
	 <li>I am strongly passionate about enabling robots to have smooth, intelligent and explainable
		  interactions (specifically, locomotion) with their environment through harmonious design of mechanics and control.</li>
	 <li>Besides robotics, I've been a hobbyist game developer for a long time. Please feel free to look around if anything here interests you! :)</li>
