 &#9635 Hello! I am Sah√°nd, currently (2024) a graduate student at the 
      <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/robotics/msc-robotics">COR department of Delft University of Technology</a>.
      With this website I aim to share a bit about myself, my research passions and my past and current projects.<br/>
 &#9635 I am generally interested in most aspects of intelligent robotic systems( machine learning, computer vision, motion planning),
      but my passion lies at the intersection of nonlinear control, machine learning
      and how bio-inspired design shapes embodied intelligence.<br/>
 &#9635 I am strongly passionate about enabling robots to have smooth, intelligent and explainable
      interactions (specifically, locomotion) with their environment through harmonious design of their mechanics and control.<br/> 
 &#9635 Besides robotics, I've been a hobbyist game developer for a long time. Please feel free to look around if anything here interests you! :)
